# Why Problem Solving Matters

Welcome to the world of **Statamatics**! Competitions are not just about winning; they are about stretching your mind.

## The Beauty of Calculus
Did you know that the integral of $1/x$ is natural log?

$$
\\int_{1}^{e} \\frac{1}{x} dx = 1
$$

This is how we render complex math equations beautifully on the web.

# Thinking Fast and Slow

Mathematics is not just about numbers, it is about **logic**.

## Example: Euler's Identity
The most beautiful equation in math:

$$
e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

It combines five of the most important numbers in mathematics.
